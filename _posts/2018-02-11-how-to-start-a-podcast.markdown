Hey everyone!

Today I want to talk about how to start a podcast. Podcasts are a great way to expand your reach and cross-platform, and they’re growing in popularity every day.

The first thing to address is this: Why a podcast? For those of you who are camera shy, this is a great option for you. Podcasts allow you to share content in a more comfortable way, which is awesome if you’re shy. Also, it’s just easier to produce. I don’t want to discredit hard work, but we all know that it’s nice to have an easier way to do what we love. Not only are podcasts easier for you, they’re easier for your audience as well. If your audience can access your content on the go, they’ll access it more. Having easily-accessible information is obviously a good thing. Easy access also includes the speed of consumption. You can put so much information in a podcast, so not only can your audience listen on the go, but they’re also getting a huge amount of information in a shorter amount of time. But on the most basic level, podcasts are great because they’re the biggest emerging platform in content creation! Take advantage of that and get a good foundation while it’s gaining popularity.

So, how do you get started? It’s simple. Podcasts can be anywhere from 5–30 minutes, it just comes down to your preference. As far as content goes, you could talk about almost anything! You could feature another individual and do an interview to expand insights. Or do a solo podcast and share your information. You could do a personal narrative or tell a story, or even do a tutorial! There are so many different possibilities. You do you, talk about what you want for how long you want, and if you talk about it the right way, you’ll find success! I have several programs and devices I would recommend for the actual recording process. I go to soundstripe.com and use stock music available there for the introductory music. Garage band is another program I use. The microphone I like the best is the Tascam DR 22WL, which has been a great product, with the Rode Mic DeadCat mic cover. There are tons of products out there that could work for you, these are just the things I use.

The trickier part of starting a podcast is figuring out the best content and actual topics to discuss. First, think about the micro and the macro. Figuring out what big picture topic you want to talk about is important because it helps you narrow down your information and address the details. I would say the best way to start is brainstorming all the general topics you want to talk about and labeling those “Macro”. Then, under each “Macro”, sketch out the “Micro” section, which is the detailed, smaller topics within the big picture. For example, if the big picture you want to discuss is “How I became a Famous Soundcloud Rapper”, a micro topic you could talk about would be “How to get more followers on Instagram for your music”, or “Story time on when I got my first 100K listens”. Do you see what I mean? Also, once again, just to address the basics, don’t forget to do an introduction and conclusion to hook them in and end in an interesting way.

The next step is the launch! Distribution is a crucial element when trying to find growth with your podcast. You need to put it up everywhere. There are tons of different platforms for podcasts, like Spotify, Soundcloud, iTunes, etc. Make sure your podcast gets everywhere so that more people find it!

My biggest tip is to make sure people are actually listening. There are plenty of ways to get and maintain an audience. After you publish your first track, don’t expect immediate success and fame. The way you get people to listen is by having the right kind of attention. To get the right attention, you need to do the right marketing. Create podcasts about topics that people are struggling with or could use advice about, not just something you think is cool. Always keep your audience and your goals in mind. I would also suggest building a mailing list and encouraging your listeners to subscribe to your email list. That way you can communicate with them better and expand your platform by getting yourself out there more. The main thing is to make sure you have a good product first, and THEN give it to your audience.

These tips and tricks made a big influence on me as I grew my platform with podcasts. If you work your podcasts, publicity, and your connection to your audience right, you’ll experience growth. Be patient, and you’ll get there!

Thanks for listening — I mean reading (haha). You guys are awesome! Good luck building your podcasts, you’ve got this!
